## Introduction

Startown is an atomic component providing you all the building blocks necessary to build any web application you need. At it's core, startown is just a robust theme engine exposing an abstract component that replaces primitive jsx (`Box`).

## Design philosophy

Startown's goal is to enable fast development. It is a completely plug and play component library with zero initial configuration.

Components expose an open and extensible prop api, where most components run without any props. This enables app developers to take an incremental approach to development.

## Installation

Install from `npmjs.com/package/startown`
